### Michael Pohoreski - programmer working on porting NFS 1 from 3DO/PC version to PSX console
Dario Komar I'll share 6 things I wish I knew back then:
1. Create a (daily) schedule for yourself. A schedule is like bones -- it provides structure. Too rigid and it will snap; too flexible and you have no foundation.
2. Learn Vim.
3. Code tells HOW, Comments tell WHY.
4. Focus is about saying no; success is about staying focused.
5. Multi-column alignment
6. There are 3 levels of optimization: Micro, Algorithmic, and Data-Orientated Design.

I knew about Vi / Vim in my college days but I always ignored it with the excuse Pfft, its just yet-another crappy Unix text editor.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

When I put together my *Vim Cheatsheet for Programmers* in 2011 I deeply regretted not learning Vim 15 years earlier! Vim was written by programmers for programmers -- it becomes an extension of your mind. *Note:* ALL text editors SUCK -- even Vim -- I just find Vim to suck the least.

There are tons more tips I could share but those are the most important ones.
